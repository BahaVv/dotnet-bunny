# Turkey

This is a test runner for running integration/regression tests for
.NET Core.

It uses the same format for identifying, selecting and running tests
as [dotnet-bunny](https://github.com/redhat-developer/dotnet-bunny/).

# TODO

- Do not modify original source files for xunit tests
- Implement timeouts for tests
